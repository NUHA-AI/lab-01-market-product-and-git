# Personal Reflection

I chose the Backend Engineer role because I enjoy the logic and data handling side of applications more than the visual interface. In this lab, the concept of "Diagrams as Code" using Mermaid was new to me; it is much cleaner to keep diagrams versioned in Git than saving images. 

Looking at the course topics, **Docker** and **CI/CD** seem the most relevant to my goal, as automating deployment is a huge part of modern backend work. One concrete skill I want to improve this semester is my ability to design a scalable database schemas, as this is the foundation of any good product.
